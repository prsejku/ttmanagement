# TrackMyGoody

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Task Management

On the "Tasks" page, you can manage the sub-projects, work packages and tasks. The default view
displays all sub-projects of the workspace. You can view the details by clicking on the name of
a sub-project. In order to see the work packages of a sub-project, you can use the drop-down
above the 'Add new Project' button and select a sub-project. The same things apply for the
then appearing "Work Packages" page and the tasks of a work package.

## Time Tracking

To use the time tracker at the top-right, you must select a sub-project ('PJ' button), a work
package ('WP' button) and a task ('T' button) to assign your tracked time to. Then simply
enter a description of max. 500 byte and click the 'start' button. After clicking the 'stop'
button, the tracked time will remain visible until you 'reset' the timer with the corresponding
button. Of course, the timer will keep running after logging out and logging in on another
device.

## Timer History

The timer history page shows a list of all time tracks in chronological order. 

## Profile

On the profile page you can edit your user profile information.

## Export

To export your tracked work time, click the 'Export' link in the menu. You will be provided
with a JSON representation of some report information

## Project Report

On the reporting page, all sub-projects, work packages and tasks are displayed as swim lanes,
including planned and actual times.

## Dashboard

The dashboard page shows a graphical report of the task distribution of your tracked time
and more useful diagrams.

## Installation

Currently no installation program or script is available. Therefore, manual installation
of [node.js](https://nodejs.org), the PHP API including a web server and
